## JavaScript Functionality

The Hotel Search Web App incorporates various JavaScript functionalities to provide a smooth user experience:

1. **Asynchronous Data Fetching**: The app leverages the fetch API to asynchronously request hotel data from an external source. This ensures that users receive up-to-date information without slowing down the application.

2. **Data Filtering**: To narrow down search results, the web app utilizes the JavaScript filter function. Users can input their preferred location, and the app filters hotel data accordingly, displaying only relevant results.

3. **DOM Manipulation**: The application dynamically creates and modifies HTML elements to present search results. It constructs elements for each hotel, displaying essential information such as names, prices, guest ratings, and availability.

4. **Event Handling**: Event listeners are employed to respond to user interactions. When users click the "Search" button, the app initiates the filtering process and updates the displayed results accordingly.

5. **String Manipulation**: To enhance search functionality, the app utilizes the `toLowerCase()` and `trim()` string methods. These ensure that searches are case-insensitive and remove leading/trailing whitespace, providing a more user-friendly search experience.

These JavaScript functionalities work together to deliver a responsive and efficient hotel search application.
